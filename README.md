In order to establish the best circuit between the LoRa module and the gas sensor introduced in the MOSH section above, we have drawn the following circuit diagram, which includes our components: a LoRa Module (RN2483) as transceiver, a Gas sensor, an amplifier (LTC1050) and two connector.

After the electrical diagram is completed, the different components must be packaged and integrated on a board. This is a complicated process, we have to consider the placement of components and the problem of circuit connection. The principle is to make the connection as simple as possible, without interleaving, and to ensure the safety of the circuit based on the correct circuit connection. Our results are as follows:

We used two layers of circuits, the lower layer was connected to ground, the voltage was zero, and the upper layer was a circuit connected to other components.

Here is the final 3d model of our results:
